Hello {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name }},

The class you are a part of on {{ site.name }} was recently reset and as a result you will no longer be able to
view your earlier submission made for the Algebraic Expressions assignment. If this assignment is reassigned in the
future, your marks from the earlier submission will be applied to it unless you choose to re-do the assignment.

Please feel free to contact us in case of any questions.

Regards,
The {{ site.name }} team
